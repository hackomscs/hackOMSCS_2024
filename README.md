# HackOMSCS 2024 ReadMe

Hello! This will be your definitive guide for hackOMSCS 2024!
HackOMSCS is an online hackathon hosted on discord to inspire innovation and creativity across various domains. Participants will compete in multiple tracks, focusing on different aspects of technology, entrepreneurship, and creativity. The event spans 24 hours, starting on May 18th at 10:00 am EST and concluding on May 19th at 10:00 am EST. Winners will be announced later on May 19th, with awards given for outstanding projects in each track.

## Schedule

Our official schedule is linked here: [HackOMSCS 2024 Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NllQFHQAlXBUs-rexLgBFh30O9Txyi8rgdTBzWMXMkM/edit#gid=466839176)

## Project Challenges

Overall Awards:

- Overall hackOMSCS winner - **$500 in AWS credits**

Challenges: You can submit your project for up to (2) of the below challenges:

- “Love at First Click” - **$200 in AWS credits**
 	- This design challenge invites you to develop a hack with innovative and visually appealing user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX).
- “AI awakening” - **$200 in AWS credits**
 	- This challenge invites you to develop an AI, or use an existing AI in your project. Be clear in your submission on what you created vs public tools you utilized in your project.
- “This is a Game Changer” - **$200 in AWS credits**
 	- This challenge invites you to create an innovative hack that solves a problem - potentially with business potential and impact.
- “Eureka!” -  **$200 in AWS credits**
 	- Build a hack that is creative or fun - something that might make us laugh!
- "It's my first day!" Award **$200 in AWS credits**
 	- This best first time hacker challenge is made to welcome new hackers (and those who work with beginners)! You are eligible for this category if at least half of your team is made of 1st time hackers.
- "Research At Scale" Award **$200 in AWS credits**
 	- This challenge invites you to develop a tool, application, or service that supports large-scale research activities. Consider how OMSCS scales learning with tools like Gradescope and Ed Discussion. How can similar technology be used to scale literature review, mentorship, collaboration, and more? Hack together a solution that makes research scalable.

# Competition Rules

1. There is a maximum team size of 4. As a participant, prizes will be split among the members of the team.
2. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.
3. All work on a project should be done at the hackathon.
4. Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
5. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
6. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code).
7. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
8. Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners.
9. Teams must submit their project to devpost by 10:00 am EST on May 19th. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.
10. Projects that violate the  [Code of Conduct](http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)  are not allowed.
11. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the  [Code of Conduct](http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf), or other unsporting behaviour.

## Judging Criteria

Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

- **Technology:**  How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?
- **Design:**  Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).
- **Completion:**  Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
- **Learning:**  Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.

These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.

It's important to note that these judging criteria do not include:

- How good your code is. It doesn't matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn't production ready, we're not going to mark you down.
- How well you pitch. Hacking is about building and learning, not about selling.
- How good the idea is. Again, hackathons aren't about coming up with innovative ideas. It's about building and learning.
- How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you're learning and having fun, that's a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks!

So don't worry about coming up with the next big idea or building the next Facebook. You'll have plenty of time for that outside the hackathon. just focus on learning, having fun, and making new friends. At the end of the day the skills you learn and the friends you make might lead to the next big thing—but you don't have to do that to win a hackathon.

# Submitting your Hack

Submit your project on devpost and sign up for a demo slot (optional). More information to be posted.
